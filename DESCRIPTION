Description: A collection of matrix functions for teaching and learning matrix linear algebra
    as used in multivariate statistical methods. These functions are mainly for tutorial purposes
    in learning matrix algebra ideas using R. In some cases, functions are provided for concepts available
    elsewhere in R, but where the function call or name is not obvious.  In other
    cases, functions are provided to show or demonstrate an algorithm.
