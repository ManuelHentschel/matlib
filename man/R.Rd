\title{Rank of a Matrix}
\usage{
R(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix}
}
\value{
rank of \code{x}
}
\description{
Returns the rank of a matrix \code{x}, using the QR decomposition, \code{qr()}.
Included here as a simple function, because \code{rank} does something different
and it is not obvious what to use for matrix rank.
