Matrix Functions for Teaching and Learning Linear Algebra and Multivariate Statistics

These functions are mainly for tutorial purposes in learning matrix algebra
ideas using R. In some cases, functions are provided for concepts available
elsewhere in R, but where the function call or name is not obvious.  In other
cases, functions are provided to show or demonstrate an algorithm.
